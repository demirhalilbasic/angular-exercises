# Angular Vježbe (Angular Exercises)

This project was developed as part of the **Web Programming** course at the **International Business-Information Academy (IPI Academy) Tuzla**. It demonstrates core Angular concepts including components, routing, directives, and data binding through practical, interactive examples.

## 📚 Project Overview

This Angular application serves as a comprehensive learning resource covering:

- **Single Page Application (SPA)** architecture with client-side routing
- **Component-based development** with standalone components
- **Angular Directives**: Structural (`*ngIf`, `*ngFor`, `*ngSwitch`), Attribute (`ngClass`, `ngStyle`), and Custom directives
- **Data Binding**: Interpolation, Property Binding, Event Binding, and Two-Way Binding
- **Modern Angular features** using Angular 21 with TypeScript

The project includes interactive demo pages where you can experiment with each concept in real-time, making it an excellent hands-on learning tool for Angular beginners.

## 🎯 Key Features

- 🏠 **Home Page** - Welcome page with project introduction
- ℹ️ **About Page** - Information about the project
- 🔧 **Directives Demo** - Interactive examples of all Angular directives
- 🔗 **Data Binding Demo** - Live demonstrations of all data binding types
- 🎨 **Responsive Design** - Clean, modern UI with custom styling
- 📱 **Navigation** - Smooth SPA navigation without page reloads

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 21.0.0.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
